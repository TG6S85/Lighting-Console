# Lighting-Console
Side Project for UCSB FSAE control systems using Teensy 4.0 Microcontroller
Akin to a lab we did in ECE152A, creating a state machine to simulate the event based control of a car's taillights.
Thought it would be neat to try to integrate this into our car, saving it here since actual model will probably be more frugal.
